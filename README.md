Baliwan Backup
==============

A small CLI utility for backups

What is this?
-------------

Just another of those command-line backup scripts, written in Python. Got the
idea of writing something like this while I was trying to backup my Thinkpad's
home directory. I realized that all I needed to backup was things unique to my
Thinkpad (config files, etc) and that all other personal stuff like music and
pictures were meant to be put in separate backups such that I can access them
anywhere without having to unpack a 100GB+ .tar archive.

Instructions
------------

Not much work is done yet, but until then watch this space.

Features (planned)
- Basic backups with rsync
- Compressed backups with tar
- Ability to create backup whitelists/blacklists for selected dirs
